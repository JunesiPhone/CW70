**Building and running a FrontPage theme on a Mac**

- Visit the FrontPage API link
- Download the API for desktop
- Unzip the file
- FPI.js needs to go in /var/FPI.js
- FrontPageCache needs to be in /var/mobile/Library/
- Open index.html in Google chrome with mobile selected

> FPI.js acts like FrontPage it initializes some random info that helps in running FrontPage themes. The FrontPageCache is a set of icons used to display all stock apps and some extras for testing. A FrontPage theme when loaded in a browser like chrome is 90% functional. Things like image picker and icon picker are not as these are views presented by FrontPage itself.

> CW70 Tip: Chrome has a white background, CW70 has a white text widget, set a black background to the body to see the widget.



> Spectrum Library was not created by me. It is created by Brian Grinstead
